The two main regex's we used in this project are:
"[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*" for identifiers
"[+-]?(\d*\.\d+|\d+\.\d*)" for doubles

The structure of the identifier regex is as follows:
1. [A-Za-z_] - The first character must be a letter (uppercase or lowercase) or an underscore.
2. [A-Za-z0-9_]* - The subsequent characters can be letters (uppercase or lowercase), digits, or underscores.
The asterisk (*) indicates that there can be zero or more of these characters.

The structure of the double regex is as follows:
1. [+-]? - The number can optionally start with a plus (+) or minus (-) sign.
2. (\d*\.\d+|\d+\.\d*) - This part matches the decimal portion of the number:
   - \d*\.\d+ - This matches numbers with digits optionally before and required after the decimal point.
   - | - This is the OR operator, indicating that either the left or right side can match.
   - \d+\.\d* - This matches numbers with digits required before the decimal point and optionally after.


The design of the project:
The project is divided into 4 packages:

1. lexer - This package contains the Lexer class, which is responsible for tokenizing the input string based
on the defined regex patterns.

2. parser - This package contains the Parser class, which takes the tokens generated by the Lexer and builds a
parse tree or abstract syntax tree (AST) based on the grammar rules.

3. ast - This package contains classes that represent the nodes of the abstract syntax tree (AST)
Each class corresponds to a different type of expression or statement in the language.

4. Semantic Analyzer - This package contains the SemanticAnalyzer class, which performs semantic analysis on
the AST to ensure that the program adheres to the language's semantic rules.
This includes type checking, scope resolution, and other semantic checks.
Each package has a specific role in the overall process of parsing and analyzing the input code, from
tokenization to semantic validation.
